        <h2>Smoked Meatloaf</h2>

        <p>Nice slow smoky meatloaf. blinded with barbecue-flavored corn chips for extra smokiness.</p>

        <ul>
            <li>2/3 cup ketchup</li>
            <li>1/4 cup tomato paste</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon apple cider vinegar</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon worcestershire sauce</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon chipotle power</li>
            <li>6 ounces barbecue-flavored corn chips (about 3 cups)</li>
            <li>3 large eggs, lightly beated</li>
            <li>2 garlic cloves, finely grated</li>
            <li>1 small onion, finely grated</li>
            <li>1 pound ground beef</li>
            <li>1 pound ground pork</li>
            <li>1 pound ground turkey</li>
            <li>Kosher salt and freashly ground black pepper</li>
        </ul>

        <ol>
            <li>Soak the wood chips in water for at least an hour and then drain.</li> <br>
            <li>Whisk together the ketchup, tomato paste, vinegar, Worcestershire and chipotle powder in a large bowl. <br> 
                Remove about a third of this mixture and set aside for the glaze.</li> <br>
            <li>Pulse the corn chips in a food processor until finely ground, then transfer to a large bowl. <br>
                Add the ketchup mixture along with the eggs. Stir to combine and let sit for long enough for the corn chips to soften, <br>
                about 10 minutes. Add the garlic, onion, beef, pork, turkey, <br> 1 tablespoon salt and a few grinds of pepper. 
                Use your hands to mix together until nicely incorporated.</li> <br>
            <li>Lay out a long piece of foil and shape the meat mixture into a loaf about 10-inches long and 2-inches thick. <br>
                Top with another piece of foil and crimp and fold the edges shut. <br>
                Poke several holes on both sides of the foil packet.</li> <br>
            <li>Prepare your smoker with the drained wood chips for 275 degrees F according to the manufacturer's instructions. <br>
                Set up a drip pan. Smoke until the meatloaf is about 130 degrees F, <br>
                about 1 hour and 30 to 45 minutes. Cut open the foil and pull it back, then brush the reserved glaze all over the top. <br>
                Continue to cook until it reaches an internal temperature of 165 degrees F, about 1 hour and 25 to 30 minutes more.</li> <br>
            <li>Let the meatloaf rest for about 10 minutes, then slice and <br><br> enjoy!</li>
        </ol>
